   <h1>Personal Webpage Project</h1>

<h3>Authored by Benedict Nagle-Rose</h3>

<p>
	A personal website created to let people find out more about me and my skills and interests
</p>
<br>
<p>
	Created using only HTML5 and CSS3 with some micromanagement completed using schema.org. The page was completed in this manner as I wanted to make a responsive webpage without using frameworks such as Bootstrap or Flexbox. It allowed me to get used to working with CSS3 and media queries to make my webpage more responsive. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
	The site itself includes information about myself and effectively acts as an online CV (I hope to add a link to a portfolio at a later date!).
